* link to github + wiki as the source of documentation

cda 1.2 (2012-08-08) 

INTERNAL CHANGES:

* explicit export of functions

* theme_minimal adapted for ggplot2

NEW FUNCTIONALITY:

* dispersion_spectrum() calculates the optical response as a function of incident angles and wavelength, for two orthogonal linear polarisation states

cda 1.1.3 (2012-02-07) 

* fixed bugs for ggplot2-0.9.0

cda 1.1.2 (2011-10-07)

cda 1.1 (2011-09-04) 
----------------------------------------

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

* New dependency on randtoolbox (Halton sequences for Quasi-Monte Carlo angular averaging.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Choice of three methods for angular averaging: regular grid, Gauss Legendre Quadrature, Quasi-Monte Carlo (default). N now refers to the  number of integration points (GL may use a slightly higher number of points, rounded as ceiling[sqrt(N)]).

* added tests/ subdirectory, featuring numerical tests of consistency.

BUG FIXES:

* Removed Encoding: UTF-8 from Description

cda 1.0 (2011-05-15) 
----------------------------------------

Initial CRAN release.
