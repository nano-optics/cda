Title: Coupled-Dipole Approximation for Electromagnetic Scattering by Three-
    Dimensional Clusters of Sub-Wavelength Particles
Description: Coupled-dipole simulations for electromagnetic scattering of
    light by sub-wavelength particles in arbitrary 3-dimensional configurations.
    Scattering and absorption spectra are simulated by inversion of the interaction
    matrix, or by an order-of-scattering approximation scheme. High-level functions
    are provided to simulate spectra with varying angles of incidence, as well as
    with full angular averaging.
